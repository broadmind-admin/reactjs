1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,020
Let's get started with react basics.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,450
Now if you've taken any of my previous courses where I've taught react or you're not a react beginner

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:18,230
and you've built some applications before with react then you can actually just skim through these videos

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,260
or skip this entire section as this section covers the react basics.

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:29,060
We're going to build our first react application from scratch using something called Create react app

6
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,160
and then we're going to deploy it to get help pages again.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:39,210
If you're completely new to react then you have to finish this section to move on with the course.

8
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,500
However for those with a bit of experience you might find this section a little bit easy.

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,200
Determine for yourself which direction you want to go remember.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:55,160
Our goal here is to build these basics so that we can build our giant application our e-commerce platform

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,680
using react.

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,990
Now in this section we're gonna learn a few things.

13
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,000
However we're going to make a few assumptions here.

14
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:11,800
First we're going to assume you know how to use your terminal or your command prompt and you can also

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:19,570
use any code editor you want you can use Visual Studio code Sublime Text or any other popular javascript

16
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,720
developer environments.

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,290
Now this section is going to be a code along.

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,610
So I highly recommend if you're following along to have your terminal or command prompt setup if you're

19
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:39,620
on Windows Terminal if you're on mac or linux system and have your code editor so you follow along.

20
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:45,560
Now over the next couple of videos we're going to install node if you don't have it already.

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,160
And also the create react app that is going to allow us to write react.

22
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,970
I do want to make a few notes though first with this course.

23
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:00,340
As long as you have a version 10 or higher for node you're going to be fine.

24
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:10,160
If you don't have a version of node on your system that is 10 or lower then I recommend updating node

25
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:17,330
or if not you can use something called End VM and end VM is a node version manager.

26
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:23,550
So it's a simple way in the terminal for us to switch node versions.

27
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,420
Now this is something you can go through on your own the easiest way to do things is to just simply

28
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,450
download node from the node j J.S..

29
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,530
Dot org Web site.

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,280
Now the second thing we're going to do is we're going to actually install something called Create react.

31
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:50,660
And if I go to react J.S. talk here and I go to Doc's under the create a new react app.

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,720
We have this thing called Create react app which we're gonna talk about in the upcoming video.

33
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:03,220
Now the one thing I want to mention is that you'll see this command and p x and MP X is actually new

34
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:14,310
and comes with version of NPM 5.2 so if your NPM version is lower than this this command won't work

35
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,090
so you might want to update your NPM version as well.

36
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,470
Now MP X for those that haven't seen it before.

37
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,370
Runs a command of a package without installing it explicit.

38
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,810
So what does that mean.

39
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,300
Well before we had MP X this is what we had to do.

40
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,680
You see here that this is the current version of react based on when you're watching the video you might

41
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,400
have versions that are higher.

42
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,040
But again this course will work with any versions higher than sixteen point eight.

43
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,780
If I go here and go to an older version of React let's say fifteen point six.

44
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:57,560
If I click on documentation and then let's do docs and then finally we look at the installation

45
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:08,440
you'll see that we had to run npm install globally create reactor and then we ran the create react up

46
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,820
command to create our app.

47
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,680
MP X allows us to not install this global version of create react app and just simply run that one comment

48
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,820
to create our app.

49
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:28,950
All right now let's go back if for some reason during this section you are unable to get this started.

50
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:35,410
There is a another option where you can use this code sandbox style which I'll link to that actually

51
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,980
allows you within the browser to use react online.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,090
Now one last thing we're gonna get started and go step by step into building our ReACT application.

53
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,580
But I also want to point something out to you.

54
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:58,010
You see when we study or learn libraries or frameworks or tools like react the best place to learn about

55
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:05,210
something is often the documentation and most tutorials don't mentioned this fact that well we have

56
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:12,980
the official react documentation that explains how we act works inside and out and most tutorials that

57
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,550
you see online are taught using this basic template.

58
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,980
So remember if you ever have questions this is always the best place to start.

59
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,380
Now we're going to be covering some main concepts and react here.

60
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,810
But remember that the way you learn a library is not like reading a dictionary where you just learn

61
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,230
every single thing that this library gives you.

62
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:43,680
The thing to understand that we'll go into later on in this course is how to build bigger and bigger

63
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,460
applications.

64
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:52,200
How to architect your app so that instead of learning something like a dictionary one by one we learn

65
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:58,350
the principles and the concepts that allow us to do advanced things and build real life applications

66
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,390
something that I'm really excited to do in this course.

67
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,700
So enough talk it's time for us to get started.

68
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,800
We're going to start setting up our environment in the next video.

69
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,420
We're going to build our first app and it's gonna be a fun one.

70
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,350
I'll see you on that one.

71
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:12,740
Bye bye.
