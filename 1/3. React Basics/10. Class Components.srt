1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:09,880
We know that we can write functions that return HMO but we can also write classes that return HMO.

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:18,310
And the reason why we would want to use a class is because react has given us the ability to write classes

3
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:24,180
that have a lot more functionality on them versus a function that returns some HMO.

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,140
Now let me show you this.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:38,300
So in order to write a class we've got a first import component from react and instead of this function

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:48,150
and I'm going to convert this into a class so class app extends this component that we get from reactive.

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:56,030
And as a result we now have access to this render method inside of our app class and the render method

8
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,850
returns any HDMI want.

9
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:06,270
So let's return that HMO we had before inside of our function and we'll see that it's actually the same

10
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,090
and to prove it.

11
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,230
I'm gonna change this tag.

12
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,940
This text here and we should see an update right.

13
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,280
Hello Iowa.

14
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:24,910
So this is great so it's pretty much the exact same at this point as are functional app that we had

15
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,410
before right.

16
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,640
Our function app that returned this block of H.

17
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:36,370
But the reason why we would want to use this kind of thing is if we wanted say instead to display this

18
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:46,200
static string of Hello You are what if I wanted something like let's say instead of an A tag we had

19
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:55,010
a button and whenever you click this button it would change the text to something else.

20
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,290
Right.

21
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:05,060
We would change this hello you want to something else well the thing about that is that by using a class

22
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:13,820
component we actually get access to this thing called state what state is is it some object right.

23
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:22,550
A javascript object with properties that we can access at any point inside of our class.

24
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:30,680
And the way we would do this is we would actually call the constructor keyword here and inside of a

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,600
constructor we want to call super right.

26
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,330
And what super does is it calls the constructor method on the component class.

27
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,370
And what that does is it gives us access to this dot state right.

28
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:49,370
This state property now exists on our class app and we can set it to something.

29
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,830
So this is the default value.

30
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,880
I want to set it to first.

31
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,200
So let's say I want to set it to the string that we have right now.

32
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,540
Right.

33
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,520
I want to set some property on our state object too.

34
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,800
Hello Iowa and then I want to render that instead of.

35
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,930
Hello Iowa.

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,970
The static string right.

37
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,320
How would I do that.

38
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:17,570
Well I would first use these curly braces which Jeff Sachs lets us do and it tells the HD and all that.

39
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:23,060
Anything between these curly braces is going to be JavaScript So I want you to render javascript right.

40
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:30,660
So we want to do this dot state DOT string and now between these p tags we watch you won't see anything

41
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,180
change because it's the same string but just to.

42
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,490
I want to say hello.

43
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:43,620
E was saying right there we see that it's looking at the state looking at this property string and rendering

44
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:50,830
that here instead so that's awesome because now I can do this in multiple places right.

45
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:58,560
I can use this as many times as I want and I'm going to see multiple versions of it right so what if

46
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:06,570
I wanted to change this value while the way I would do it is this class app that extends component this

47
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:14,460
component also gives us this method called set state and what sets state does is it lets us modify this

48
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,380
state object right on every single H html element.

49
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:28,170
We now have access to this method this property called on click which takes a function that gets called

50
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:35,950
when ever this element gets clicked so let's pass in this function and in this function we're gonna

51
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:45,510
say this dot set state and what's that say takes is an object with all of the properties that you want

52
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,480
to change on your state as well as the new values that they have.

53
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:56,180
So I want to change the property string to Hello Andre.

54
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,700
Now when I click this button it will see that it changed right.

55
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,970
And that's really awesome because this gives us a lot of control over what we want our components to

56
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,470
display.

57
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,760
So this will be really really useful later when we don't know where we're going to get some of the information

58
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:23,710
that we actually want to display inside of our HCM out but I'm going to show you in the next lesson

59
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,560
why this is really useful.
