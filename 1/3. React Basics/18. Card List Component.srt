1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,620
OK so now we're going to start converting our current application to look more like the final application

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,750
before we do that.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,810
We've got to take a look at this idea of components.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,920
So right now we do know that are only component is the app component.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,250
Right.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,570
We've only written this one single class based component which is our app.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:37,830
However in react what we want to do is we want to be able to break our code into smaller reusable pieces

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,630
that are only focused on one responsibility.

9
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:43,190
Right.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,950
So when we look at this we see that this card seems to be its own component.

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:57,120
This search bar is its own component and in a way because this card is itself it doesn't really care

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,730
about the other cards around it.

13
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:06,000
So there's got to be something that seems to be containing every single card on our page.

14
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,790
And that is going to be another component.

15
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:16,410
Now when we build that outside wrapping component we're going to actually take a deeper look into what

16
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,150
components are in react.

17
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:30,830
So let's first make a components folder and inside we will make a card list folder and in that card

18
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:36,610
list folder we're going to make a card list dot component dot JSF.

19
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,380
Now you don't need this stock component part but I like to add it just so that I can tell right away

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,810
what kind of file that is.

21
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:55,410
So this is our component file and we need to import react from react and we're going to export out this

22
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,160
card list right.

23
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,700
And it's going to be a functional component.

24
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,450
And what we want to display for now is just a containing div.

25
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:12,390
Now one of the big things about components is that they take in something called Props and props is

26
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,300
going to be the parameter that we get from our functional component.

27
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,510
Right.

28
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:25,140
So right now let's just log this out and see what this looks like because it's important for us to know

29
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:33,030
what props actually are and inside of this div I'm just going to put how low for now and let's console

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,500
logout props.

31
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,690
Right.

32
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,670
So now we know that we're logging it out when we put it on our actual application and we're going to

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,140
import it into our app file import card list

34
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,960
components card list card let's component.

35
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,550
Now let's just put this above here for now and let's not put anything into it.

36
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:06,560
Now you remember earlier when I said that there are these this props parameter.

37
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,120
Right.

38
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,970
This is actually going to be any parameter that we pass into card list.

39
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:20,530
So if here we say there is a prop called name and we pass in e law.

40
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,040
Right.

41
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,260
Then what will actually log out when we look at our app.

42
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,860
Is this card list that says name.

43
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,270
Right.

44
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:32,590
And then it says Iva so right there is our card list component.

45
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,820
And right here you see that we're actually locking it out.

46
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,370
We're logging out E.

47
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,310
Right.

48
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:44,140
So that prop is going to be an object of any properties that you write onto this component where it

49
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,790
gets used now.

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,980
Generally speaking of course we want the props that we're actually going to pass in to match the parameters

51
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,770
that we're actually gonna use instead of our component.

52
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:05,290
But one of the main properties that exists on this props object is one called children it will always

53
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,410
be there but it if there's no children it'll be null.

54
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:18,600
So what are children children are actually what you pass in between the brackets of our component that

55
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,740
gets called.

56
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:26,540
So if in here I say e are then the children prop will be this yeehaw.

57
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,260
Right.

58
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:35,180
Actually I'm even going to make it an H want just so that I can show that it's anything in between these

59
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,290
tags.

60
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:44,780
So now if we instead render a prop stop children gotta remember to use the squiggly brackets because

61
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,720
that tells that we're going to use javascript and now we see Iowa.

62
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:57,480
And this is an H1 as well so that's one of the big things about props and components.

63
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,120
We actually have access to props as well on our app component on the this keyword.

64
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,720
It gets attached to our actual class as a property called Props.

65
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:13,470
So if we want to access it we would use this stop props but because we're not using it yet there's no

66
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,370
reason to do so.

67
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,120
But in a later lesson we'll actually see what that will look like.

68
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,720
But for now let's just focus on our card list.

69
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,130
So we're adding in these prompts.

70
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:23,520
Right.

71
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,790
We're passing the children in because we do want that and then we're going to actually do some of the

72
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,330
styling to make it look more like this.

73
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:38,720
So we noticed that this is in kind of like a four column grid.

74
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,280
Well I actually have some of the CSX written already for us that you guys can get from the file but

75
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,680
I'm just going to include it and I don't want to focus too much on the CSX because it might be a little

76
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,730
bit too much to think about when we're trying to learn react right now.

77
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,840
But there is one thing I want to highlight.

78
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,280
So first let's make a card list.

79
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,680
Dot style's dot CSX and let's add that it.

80
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,050
So all I'm saying really really quickly is that I'm ad I'm using the new CSX grid right.

81
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,650
I'm setting the display to grid.

82
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:21,320
I am saying that I want the grid to make everything fit within four of these columns each one being

83
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:29,180
the size of one fraction which is essentially an equal part of the overall size of what the width of

84
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,340
this cordless will be.

85
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:36,020
So there's just four equal columns and then between each column there will be 20 pixels.

86
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,120
So let's use it and see what it looks like.

87
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,180
So it's import that in

88
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:51,480
and then let's put it on so let's get rid of this for now and let's put it on.

89
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:57,610
So our class name will be card if we save it.

90
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,940
We will see now that it was in here.

91
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,260
Right.

92
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,820
But we want everything in there as well.

93
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,060
Right.

94
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:13,570
So now instead of passing you all through I want to pass all of our monsters through right.

95
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,880
So again this map is going to generate our list of those H ones the same way.

96
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,900
But then it's going to put it as the children in between this div that we have as our card list component

97
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:34,440
and now if we look we see that it's in an equal grid of four equal columns.

98
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:40,460
So this is a really really fundamental thing about react is that we're just building components that

99
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:49,010
only care about one thing and our card lists component only cares about displaying cards inside of it

100
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,800
in some kind of configuration.

101
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:59,970
Right now the next thing we're going to look at in the next lesson is taking that idea a step further

102
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,280
and we're going to apply it to this card component next see in the next one.
