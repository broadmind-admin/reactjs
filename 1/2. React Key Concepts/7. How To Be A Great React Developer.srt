1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:05,920
We learned the four main concepts that really made react takeoff.

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,710
It gave developers a whole new way to think about their applications and how we built them.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,580
And it was architected in such a way that it made building large scale applications a lot more pleasant

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,910
than what we had before now.

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:30,300
Since then a lot of libraries have come out that have taken some of the react concepts angular was rewritten

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,610
to a new version that is more in line with these concepts.

7
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:43,470
Libraries like Vue are also using these concepts because people have realized that these are some really

8
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,090
good principles.

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:52,110
So now you have things like react to angular a view that developers are using to build front end applications

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,340
but react really had this initial jump and it's still the most popular library and the library with

11
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:07,220
the most job demand because it was the first to introduce these principles and the beauty is that although

12
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:13,620
we haven't written any code you've now learned a little bit about some of the key words that will encounter

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,670
throughout this course.

14
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,430
And don't worry you're not supposed to get them 100 percent just now because all of these things are

15
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,650
something that we need to practice code and build projects with to really understand them.

16
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,920
But now when you hear the words like declarative J.S. x component state props virtual Dawn You'll least

17
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:38,930
have an idea of what it is because we've learned that react as a declarative paradigm that is instead

18
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,060
of telling our apps exactly what to do.

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:50,390
We simply give it some state some components that are built with something called J.S. X and these components

20
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,050
sometimes receive properties which are called Props.

21
00:01:54,050 --> 00:02:02,900
We give all that information a giant javascript object in a declarative way which creates a virtual

22
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:13,040
DOM in JavaScript in that virtual DOM is used by the react library to update the DOM for us in a declarative

23
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:23,510
way but your question is this how do I become the best reactive helper I can be and to be a great reactive

24
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,090
helper.

25
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,900
It actually comes down to three things three things that really really good senior reactive operas do

26
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,940
well and we're going to focus on these three skills throughout the course.

27
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,860
The first one is to decide on components really good reactive helpers decide what is a component.

28
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,030
How much do we want to break down a component.

29
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,120
How do we build these reusable components.

30
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:53,880
As we've seen in deciding on how to break down the app into different components is a very important

31
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,900
skill.

32
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,450
The next thing is to decide the state and where it lives.

33
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,410
Now we're going to explore this idea of state or data of our app a lot more.

34
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:11,580
But this state can live in different locations in our virtual dorm so whether we put the state here

35
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,110
or we put the state here or here or here or in multiple locations.

36
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:23,400
That decision is very important in architecting your app and really good react developers do a really

37
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,090
good job placing state in the appropriate component.

38
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:37,020
The third is what changes should we make when the state changes based on what this javascript object

39
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,000
called state is changed.

40
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:48,720
We have to decide what to render what part of the virtual DOM changes and deciding on this is also important

41
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,230
because it has huge effects on performance.

42
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,860
Now don't worry these are the things that we're going to really work on but I want you to keep this

43
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:04,340
as a reference because if you want to become a senior react developer These are the things that you

44
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,520
have to become really good at making these decisions and knowing when something is good when when something

45
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,000
is bad.

46
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,000
We're going to explore that and a lot more in the next section.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,070
I'll see in the next one.

48
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:17,680
Bobby.
