Hello and welcome to the best react course online.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:10,830
Wow that's a that's a bit of a bold statement and OK I may be biased here but I'm definitely looking

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,850
forward to us diving into some fun topics and coming out the other end as great react developers this

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,750
course tries to build onto each topic and gets more and more advanced as you progressed.

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,240
Trust me if you go through everything you will come out the other end.

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,310
Confident with react and be able to manage or even lead react projects your company now.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,440
Before we dive into coding building projects and learning about react I want to take a moment and understand

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,710
why react exists.

9
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,810
What problem does it solve.

10
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,600
Why it makes front end development easier and also what principles we need to understand to be more

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,090
than the average react developer.

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,810
You see a lot of times people learn a tool a library or a framework without understanding the core principles

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,770
that make it great by learning these things first.

14
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,010
We'll have a foundation as we move through the course and understand what the best practices are.

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,840
The goal of this course is not to be another react course like thousands of others already out there

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,040
in existence.

17
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,770
The goal is to make you a reactive helper that can think on your own.

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,570
Make good architectural decisions and lead projects instead of only following tutorials.

19
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,820
Therefore in this section let's dive into the important principles that will help us get through this

20
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,670
course.

21
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,730
If you are new to react some of these principles may be hard to understand at first.

22
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:44,400
Rest assured that we will keep revisiting them throughout the course as we learn for those that have

23
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,070
already worked with react.

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,800
You may learn a thing or two so hang in there.

25
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,700
My goal by the end of this section is for you to be able to explain to other programmers the benefit

26
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,350
of react without writing a single line of code I do recommend that this section is something you come

27
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,830
back to after you've watched through the entire course.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,670
All right enough talk let's get started.
