1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,160
So we've learned the first two concepts.

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:12,620
The third concept that made to react really popular is this idea of you need directional data flow.

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,170
What do I mean by that.

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:23,000
Well so far we understand that React is just a javascript library that allows us to write more javascript

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,330
to have interactivity on our Web sites and in react.

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:34,840
We have this idea of state which you can think of it as a javascript object that describes our app.

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,680
So all the data of our app is within this state.

8
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:48,190
And then we also learned about this idea of components that we can build using react with this weird

9
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:57,280
e-mail looking thing but inside of our JavaScript files this idea of state which is the data over app

10
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:05,670
works with the components which are built using what will eventually learn is called J.S. X..

11
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:17,420
So it's a simple like syntax inside of JavaScript and These all combine to essentially give our reactive

12
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:24,480
library to things that is the components that we've built the state over application and you can think

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:31,890
of this as a function a react library is simply a function that we give all these things to what it's

14
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:41,490
going to do is it's going to create what we call a virtual DOM that is it creates a javascript version

15
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,370
of the Dom.

16
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,060
Remember this.

17
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:51,800
This isn't the Dom we installed the react plugin to have something that looks like the elements tab

18
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,760
but isn't.

19
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,690
Exactly.

20
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:03,190
And this is just a javascript object that describes our app into what we called this virtual Dawn which

21
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:12,520
is a tree like object like this that gives react a blueprint of how it should update the actual Dawn.

22
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,360
So what happens then is react.

23
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:23,220
Takes all of this and says hey here is the actual dawn or the document object model of the Web site

24
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:32,080
and the react little bot over here is going to go look at the blueprint of what it needs to build and

25
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:41,610
modifies the DOM for us now this idea of a unique directional data flow means that any time we want

26
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,480
something to change on our Web page.

27
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,030
Well the state has to change.

28
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,160
That is the data has to change in our app.

29
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:57,450
So what happens if as a user I click on let's say a button while I click on a button.

30
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,030
React is going to intercept that and say hey somebody just clicked on the bottom.

31
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,530
How does that.

32
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,120
Let's say I click on the sign up.

33
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,590
React is going to say hey somebody just clicked on the sign out button.

34
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,150
How are we going to change the state.

35
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,960
Well internally we would say that if somebody clicks on the sign out we're gonna change is logged in

36
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:29,130
to now say false and react as soon as the state changes reacts to that change and says hey the state

37
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:37,440
just Shane combine the new state and the components we have and update the dot you see the data only

38
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:47,270
flows one way a better way to think about this is like this our application is simply built with this

39
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,440
virtual Dawn.

40
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:58,210
This javascript object that describes our app and as soon as a state changes it's going to trickle down

41
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:04,900
that information and let everybody know hey the state just changed if is logged in is now false.

42
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,690
Display this version of the app data can never move up.

43
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:17,740
So for example the state as we'll learn can live in different locations different components and if

44
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,280
the state lets say changes here the data can never move up.

45
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,480
That is all these changes can only trickle down now.

46
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,060
This concept is hard to explain without actually seeing it in code.

47
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,460
So if you don't get this right away don't worry.

48
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,200
We will explore this idea and revisit this idea of one way data flow throughout the course.

49
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:47,710
But the key takeaway here is that by having this restriction of data only being able to move down from

50
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:54,190
the state of our application all the way to the DOM and if any changes or events happen that change

51
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:01,120
the state while we go back to the state and that's state change trickles down to different components

52
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:09,760
in one direction is a restriction on how data can move through our app and by adding this restriction

53
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,350
it's really easy to debug code.

54
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,500
For example if there's something wrong with our sign our function.

55
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,720
I can go to wherever the state is logged in lives.

56
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,920
Let's say it lives in this top component here I can go over here and know that this is where the bug

57
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,910
is happening and whatever is underneath this component.

58
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,140
Well that's it.

59
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,840
I don't have to look outside of the component of the tree was massive with thousands and millions of

60
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,440
components.

61
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:47,230
I only have to look in the place where the data exists and where the data flows through.

62
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:51,340
Again this is a really hard concept that we will explore throughout the course.

63
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,750
But this idea of one way data flow is the restriction.

64
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:02,350
And because of this restriction it's easier for us to understand how our app works unlike the arrows

65
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:08,890
and points that we saw with an angular app where things got confusing really really fast.
