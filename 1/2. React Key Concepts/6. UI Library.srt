1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:06,870
So we've learned that react takes care of Dom changes for us using something called virtual Dawn.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,750
We learn that we build the Web sites with components.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:16,180
And this idea of you need directional data flow where data only flows one way so that it's easier to

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,370
debug our code.

5
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:26,090
Then the final thing that really made react stand out is this idea of hey I'm just the UI.

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,580
The rest is up to you.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,060
What do you mean by this well.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:40,930
Remember how with angular it came with all these things built in that is angular J.S..

9
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,000
It was a framework and a framework is kind of like a whole kitchen.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,770
It gives the developers all the tools necessary to build an application.

11
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:57,550
So if you're a cook in a kitchen while you get the oven you get the nice you get the drawers you get

12
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,620
the pots and pans.

13
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,230
You have the stove you have everything for you.

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,140
And this is how you cook or this is how you build a Web site.

15
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,060
It's very opinionated.

16
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:17,620
On the other hand react said Hey I only care about this whole idea of components and virtual DOM and

17
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:26,050
I only am going to work with the view the user interface everything else that you need while you can

18
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:34,690
just use other modules other libraries and mix and match and have whatever you want customized to your

19
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,510
need.

20
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,990
So it was a library a UI library which is not like a kitchen.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,460
It's more like let's say the stove they gave you the stove to cook your soup on but everything else

22
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,370
like knife cutting board spoon.

23
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,400
Well you can pick whichever one you want.

24
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,190
It's up to you what you use to build that soup.

25
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:07,920
All we give you is this oven and the key idea was that because it was so small you can learn once and

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,270
write anywhere.

27
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,950
What does that mean.

28
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:19,290
Well react doesn't make assumptions about what technology stack you use all we give you is hey here

29
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:27,210
is this idea of components of a blueprint that we can use a massive javascript object to make changes.

30
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:36,170
And here's also a robot that will interact with the Dom and makes changes for you but because of this

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,880
we actually are able because it only focuses with the UI we're actually able to move react to other

32
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:51,920
places other than well let's say the Web for example we now can have different robots that interact

33
00:02:51,920 --> 00:03:01,250
with different views and all they need is this main react library or blueprint of how to well look at

34
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,540
a javascript object and say hey change this UI.

35
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:13,370
So now you could have things like react native and this little robot can look at this blueprint and

36
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:20,270
say change the view in a Iow app an Android app.

37
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:27,210
And although it might not know anything about the DOM it only needs to know about views in a mobile

38
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,010
app.

39
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:36,990
You also have things like react 360 which is VR apps and again using this blueprint of react I can use

40
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:42,640
it for VR apps and this little robot or library can focus on VR.

41
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:49,050
We also have things like electron and react desktop that allows us to build desktop applications and

42
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:55,530
they interact with Windows and Mac OS and Linux operating systems.

43
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:02,900
We even have things like react to blessed that work with the terminal and the command prompt and because

44
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:12,320
of this react was able to use this concept and have developers that originally just wrote for Web sites

45
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:19,760
on the browser to now use the same idea and the same principles and the same javascript code to build

46
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:25,700
desktop applications to build VR applications to build mobile applications.

47
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:33,640
And this idea of cross platform really took off with react and you'll notice when we start building

48
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:40,630
our projects that we actually import to libraries and react the core react library which is this little

49
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:49,120
robot and the react dorm library which is this specific robot that only knows how to interact with the

50
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,220
dorm or the web browser.
