00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,400
Now the success of React comes down to four key things.
1

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,820
And these React concepts are we going to go over in the next four videos.
2

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,420
But in this one let's talk about the first one and the first one React says: hey don't touch the DOM
3

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,040
I'll do it.
4

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,840
What do I mean by this?
5

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:28,600
You see, many existing frameworks and libraries before React where directly manipulating this Dom on
6

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,760
every page.
7

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:38,280
First let's just go over what a Dom is. If you remember Dom is our Document Object Model.
8

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:47,940
It's what the browser uses to display a Web Site or a web app, and Javascript is simply manipulating
9

10
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:48,560
this Dom.
10

11
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,360
That's all javascript is doing.
11

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:01:00,790
For example if I right click over here and select Inspect and you'll see that here if I click on
12

13
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:06,500
un vote we'll get a little flash saying that hey javascript just updated this.
13

14
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:15,030
If I click again, again I get a little flash. The DOM is just the tree representation of the page.
14

15
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:21,740
We start all the way up from the HTML tag all the way down to the body through each individual elements
15

16
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:30,950
and Web sites were built using things like this all these ways that browsers allowed us to manipulate
16

17
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,960
the DOM.
17

18
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:38,690
They gave us the DOM API that we could access using something like innerHTML or get element by I.D.
18

19
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:48,260
get elements by tag name this API allowed us to traverse the DOM access any node we wanted to maybe
19

20
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,850
remove them add new nodes and before React.
20

21
00:01:51,860 --> 00:02:00,590
This is what libraries did you either did this manually or you used jQuery or you use some sort of
21

22
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:07,310
a library that allows you to use this in a simple fashion you see this way of programming was called
22

23
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:18,950
imperative: that is in an imperative paradigm you directly change individual parts of your app in response
23

24
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:29,390
to various user events. so you had let's say your javascript file you'd say: hey if user is logged in.
24

25
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,810
Well then go change that little icon over here to the user's profile.
25

26
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,750
And now that the user is logged in, well, also show profile page.
26

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,540
OK so javascript goes changes the Dom and updates the profile page and then OK.
27

28
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,370
Now that we have we're also logged in.
28

29
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,930
We also need to display friends.
29

30
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,240
OK.
30

31
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,880
Let's do that as well modify the Dom and.
31

32
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,240
All right.
32

33
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,070
That's good we're good.
33

34
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,250
Oh by the way it's been five seconds and we need to display a chat over here.
34

35
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,670
OK.
35

36
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,180
I'm going to go and do that now.
36

37
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:06,280
This sounds intuitive but the problem with this imperative approach is that it becomes difficult to
37

38
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,180
see the relationships between events and all these edge cases.
38

39
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,370
Remember this diagram over here where we had AngularJS that all of a sudden had all these relationships
39

40
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,340
affecting each other and all these errors pointing to different things. Well, instead of this imperative
40

41
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:33,500
approach React came up with a novel concept a more declarative approach and this is what React says to
41

42
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,180
you.
42

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,300
Hey Dom manipulation is one of the biggest performance bottlenecks.
43

44
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,530
It takes a long time for Dom changes to happen.
44

45
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,040
The browser has to do two really intensive operations.
45

46
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,490
One is to repaint.
46

47
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:55,370
That is change an element and added onto a page and then refloat which is to recalculate the layout
47

48
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,640
of the page and move things around if need be.
48

49
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,810
So changing the Dom was a really expensive operation.
49

50
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,760
So React says: hey you know what.
50

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,560
Let me take care that I'll find the best way for me to change the Dom and just declare to me what your
51

52
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,550
app looks like.
52

53
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:23,660
So all we need to do is say hey this is a javascript object of how I want the app to look and React
53

54
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:32,240
is going to hold this javascript object this massive massive blueprint of how things should look.
54

55
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:40,220
And based on this blueprint that we give it React just says hey just tell me what the page should
55

56
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,330
look like and I'll take care of it.
56

57
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll do everything for you.
57

58
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,770
I'll find the best way to use the DOM.
58

59
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,440
You're never going to touch the DOM.
59

60
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,660
Just tell me what the page should look like.
60

61
00:04:51,740 --> 00:05:00,200
This declarative paradigm is called that because we declare that hey this is what the state or data
61

62
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,880
of our app should be like.
62

63
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,150
And based on this date.
63

64
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,480
Well then just make those changes.
64

65
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:13,470
So if a user is logged in then React already knows exactly what to update and what to do.
65

66
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:20,840
Now this idea of a declarative style meant that we didn't have to directly say do this and if this happens
66

67
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,440
then do that where we just say one by one exactly what should happen.
67

68
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:34,210
Instead we tell it this is the state of our app and React automatically just does it for us.
68

69
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:40,310
The difference is that all the different states are accounted for in one place.
69

70
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:46,210
That is one big javascript object that describes how our app should look.
70

71
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:53,800
And this resulted in less complexity better code quality and faster developer times.
71

72
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:00,080
So it created this whole idea of: hey you can build web interfaces without touching the Dom and this
72

73
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:08,840
is where the name React came from. The name React is simply saying hey based on whatever the state or
73

74
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,200
data of the app is that describes our app, I'm just going to React to it and change everything for you
74

75
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,090
so that you get the display that you want.
